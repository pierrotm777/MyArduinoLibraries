  @brief
  Camera Action Manager

  The Caamera Action Manager class controls a camera's focus and shutter
  lines, given that these lines are attached to an arduino device via
  an optocoupler or similar device.  The focus and shutter lines are
  driven HIGH to trigger the given action.

  All actions performed by the Camera Action Manager are non-blocking, and
  this library uses the MsTimer2 library to achieve this.  For this reason,
  you may only have one such object instantiated in your program, and under
  no circumstances should you attempt to use MsTimer2 in another part of
  your program while a camera action is being performed.

  Status reporting from the Camera Manager is handled via a callback function,
  which you may specify.  This function will be called at the beginning and
  completion of any action with a special code to indicate the status.  For
  more information on this, see setHandler().

  The default pins for the shutter and focus are 13 and 12, respectively.
  You may, however specify the shutter and focus pins via the constructor.

  Example:

  @code
   // note: You -always- have to include the MSTimer2 library in an arduino
   // sketch before including the OMCamera header

#include "MsTimer2.h"
#include "OMCamera.h"

OMCamera Camera = OMCamera();

void setup() {

  Camera.setHandler(camCallBack);

  Serial.begin(19200);

}

void loop() {

  if( ! Camera.busy()  ) {
      // camera is not busy doing anything, so we're ready to
      // start another cycle
    Serial.println("Round Begin, Triggering Focus");
    Camera.focus(1000);
  }

}

void camCallBack(byte code) {

  switch(code) {

    case OM_CAM_FFIN:  // focus finish code received

      Serial.println("Focus Done, Triggering Exposure");
        // trigger an exposure
      Camera.expose(1000);
      break;

    case OM_CAM_EFIN: // exposure finish code received

      Serial.println("Exposure Done, Waiting.");

        // wait (non-blocking wait implemented via timer2) for 10 seconds
      Camera.wait(10000);
      break;

    case OM_CAM_WFIN: // wait finish code received

        // we do nothing, because this is the end of a sshot cycle -
        // the main loop will pick up again witth focus, because the
        // camera will no longer register as busy.

      Serial.println("Wait Done, Round Complete");
      Serial.println("");
      break;
  }
}
