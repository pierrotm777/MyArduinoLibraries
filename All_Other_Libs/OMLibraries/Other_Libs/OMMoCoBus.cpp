/** Send Packet Header

 Sends a complete packet header, given an address to target, a packet code to
 ssend, and the length of data that will be sent.

 This method is part of a low-level toolkit for creating MoCoBus handlers, and
 should not be used in part of a normal Node implementation.  Instead, see
 OMMoCoNode::response().

 If you send a packet header to the broadcast address (as defined by OM_SER_BCAST_ADDR),
 the method isBroadcast() will return true immediately after calling this method. You
 can use this in higher-level classes to determine if a response should be expected.

 A MoCoBus packet always starts with a 10-byte header with the following structure:

 <table border=1 width="80%">
 <tr>
 <td>0</td>
 <td>1</td>
 <td>2</td>
 <td>3</td>
 <td>4</td>
 <td>5</td>
 <td>6</td>
 <td>7</td>
 <td>8</td>
 <td>9</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td colspan=6><b>Break Sequence</b></td>
 <td><b>Sub-address</b></td>
 <td><b>Address</b></td>
 <td><b>Packet Code</b></td>
 <td><b>Data Len</b></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>0</td>
 <td>0</td>
 <td>0</td>
 <td>0</td>
 <td>0</td>
 <td>255</td>
 <td>0-255</td>
 <td>0-255</td>
 <td>0-255</td>
 <td>0-255</td>
 </tr>
 </table>

 Note that all multi-byte values sent using the MoCoBus specification are in
 Big-Endian (Network) byte order!

 There are two types of packets which may be sent on MoCoBus, and they are not
 differentiated except in the order in which they occur:

 Command Packet

 A command packet is sent by a Master, and may have up to 254 packet codes, from
 1-255.  0 is never a valid packet code for a command packet.  Up to 255 data
 bytes may be included with the packet, as long as they do not include a sequence
 which corresponds to the break sequence noted above.

 Generally speaking, due to the limitation of 254 packet codes, the protocol for
 a specific node type will likely define a series of sub-codes for use as the
 first byte or set of bytes in the packet data.


 Response Packet

 A response packet is sent by a Node, in response to a command packet, back to
 the master.  It should only have two valid packet codes: 0 and 1, with 0 indicating
 an error occured processing the command and 1 indicating that the command
 was successfully completed.  Response packets may or may not contain actual
 packet data, this will depend on the specific implementation by the node.


 @param p_addr

 @param p_code

 @param p_dlen
