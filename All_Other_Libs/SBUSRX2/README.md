This library is based on on the BolderFlight [SBUS](https://github.com/bolderflight/SBUS)
library, q.v. for details.  I made the following modifications:

* Removed servo code

* Put class library code into src folder

* Added support for interrupt-based interaction

* Moved platform-specific code to [examples](https://github.com/simondlevy/SBUSRX/tree/master/examples)
