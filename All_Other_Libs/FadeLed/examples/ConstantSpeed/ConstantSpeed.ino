 *  @brief Show difference between constant fade speed and constant fade time
 *  
 *  @details This is an example to show the difference between constant fade 
 *  speed (default) and constant fade time. Both LEDs will just fade up and 
 *  down to halve brightness with the same time set. One with constant fade 
 *  speed, one with constant fade time.
 *  
 *  pin 5: Constant fade speed
 *  This LED will fade with constant fade speed. The time set is the time it
 *  takes between off and full brightness (or vice versa). So when fading
 *  by less then all the steps (255) it's finished in less time. For 
 *  example, fading to halve brightness will also take have the time.
 *  
 *  pin 6: Constant fade time
 *  This LED will fade with constant fade time. The time set is the time it
 *  takes for one fade, no matter the values from/to it fades. For example,
 *  a fade between off and full brightness will take the same time as a fade 
 *  from off to 100. Useful for example if you want to fade a RGB LED from 
 *  one color to another in a set time, no matter the levels of the 
 *  individual colors.
