 Example of reading of a large file and outputting to a different software serial port (like Bluetooth)

 This example connects to OpenLog over the hardware serial pins (pins 0 and 1) at 9600bps,
 then opens a file called 'bigtext.txt',
 then reports the contents of that file to a Bluetooth (or other serial) device over software serial on pins 9/10 at 14400bps.
 
 Note: We listen to OpenLog at 9600 but report to Bluetooth at 14400 in order to avoid dropping characters. 115200bps,
 57600bps, 19200 and 14400 works great. Reporting to the device hooked to softare serial at 9600 will not work.
 
 Note: You must disconnect OpenLog from the Arduino's TX and RX pins when flashing new firmware onto the Arduino.
 
 Connect the following OpenLog pins to Arduino:
 TXO of OpenLog to pin 0 on the Arduino
 RXI to 1
 GRN to 4
 VCC to 5V
 GND to GND
 
 Connect the following Bluetooth pins to Arduino:
 RXI of Bluetooth serial device to pin 9 on the Arduino
 TXO to 10 (not really used)
 
 This example code assumes the OpenLog is set to operate at 9600bps in NewLog mode, meaning OpenLog 
 should power up and output '12<'. This code then sends the three escape characters and then sends 
 the commands to create a new random file called log###.txt where ### is a random number from 0 to 999.
 The example code will then read back the random file and print it to the serial terminal.
 
 This code assume OpenLog is in the default state of 9600bps with ASCII-26 as the esacape character.
 If you're unsure, make sure the config.txt file contains the following: 9600,26,3,0
 
 Be careful when sending commands to OpenLog. println() sends extra newline characters that 
 cause problems with the command parser. The new v2.51 ignores \n commands so it should be easier to 
 talk to on the command prompt level. This example code works with all OpenLog v2 and higher.

  //Old way

  //New way

      if(Serial.read() == '\r') break;

  //This will listen for characters coming from OpenLog and print them to the terminal
  //This relies heavily on the SoftSerial buffer not overrunning. This will probably not work

  //BluetoothOut.println(charactersRead);

  //This is not perfect. The above loop will print the '.'s from the log file. These are the two escape characters
  //recorded before the third escape character is seen.
  //It will also print the '>' character. This is the OpenLog telling us it is done reading the file.
