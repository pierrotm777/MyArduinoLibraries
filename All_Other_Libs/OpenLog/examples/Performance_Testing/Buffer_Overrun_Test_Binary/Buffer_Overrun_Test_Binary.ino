 This code is public domain but you buy me a beer if you use this and we meet someday (Beerware license).
 
 This sketch is used to test the recording buffer of the OpenLog. If you send OpenLog non-stop
 serial data at very high data rates (like 115200bps) it can cause a buffer over-run. This sketch
 attempts to cause such situations by sending a large batch of characters to the serial port at 115200bps.
 Original test was recomended by ScottH on issue #12:
 http://github.com/nseidle/OpenLog/issues#issue/12
 
 Arduino TX to OpenLog RXI
 Arduino 5V to OpenLog VCC
 Arduino GND to OpenLog GND
 
 To use this sketch, attach RXI pin of OpenLog to TX pin on Arduino. Power OpenLog from 5V (or 3.3V) and GND pins from Arduino.
 After power up, OpenLog will start flashing (indicating it's receiving characters). It takes about 1 minute for 
 the sketch to run to completion. This will create a file that looks like this:
 
 ...
 6:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ-!#
 7:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ-!#
 8:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ-!#
 9:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ-!#
 #:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ-!#
 1:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ-!#
 2:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ-!#
 ...
 
 The reason for creating these character blocks is it allows for a reader to very quickly scan the visible characters and 
 indentify any byte errors or glitches along the way. Every 9 lines we print a 10th line that has a leading character 
 such as # or !. These allow us to quickly see the different blocks of 10 lines.
 
 Note: Bootloading an Arduino will cause OpenLog to drop to command mode. This is because OpenLog is looking for the 
 escape character (ctrl+z). During a bootload, all sorts of characters get sent to the Arduino and therefore ctrl+z is likely
 to get sent to OpenLog. v1.51 of the OpenLog firmware fixes this potential error by requiring three escape characters.
