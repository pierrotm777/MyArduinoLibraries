/*
 Example of creating a file, reading a file, and reading the disk properties on OpenLog

 License: This code is public domain but you buy me a beer if you use this and we meet someday (Beerware license).

 This example puts OpenLog in command mode with and without LED so we can test current
 consumption during command prompt.
 
 Connect the following OpenLog to Arduino:
 RXI of OpenLog to pin 2 on the Arduino
 TXO to 3
 GRN to 4
 VCC to 5V
 GND to GND
 
 This example code assumes the OpenLog is set to operate at 9600bps in NewLog mode, meaning OpenLog 
 should power up and output '12<'. This code then sends the three escape characters and then sends 
 the commands to create a new random file called log###.txt where ### is a random number from 0 to 999.
 The example code will then read back the random file and print it to the serial terminal.
 
 This code assume OpenLog is in the default state of 9600bps with ASCII-26 as the esacape character.
 If you're unsure, make sure the config.txt file contains the following: 9600,26,3,0
 
 Be careful when sending commands to OpenLog. println() sends extra newline characters that 
 cause problems with the command parser. The new v2.51 ignores \n commands so it should be easier to 
 talk to on the command prompt level. This example code works with all OpenLog v2 and higher.
