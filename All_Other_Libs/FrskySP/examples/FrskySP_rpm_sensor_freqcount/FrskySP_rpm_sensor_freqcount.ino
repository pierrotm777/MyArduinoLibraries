/*
 * RPM sensor for Frsky Smart Port protocol.
 *
 * Requirements
 * ------------
 * - FrskySP library: https://github.com/jcheger/frsky-arduino
 * - FreqCount library: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_FreqCount.html
 * 
 * The RPM pin is 5 and cannot be changed (defined by the FreqCount library). The RPMs are refreshed once per second.
 *
 * See the the images in the example folder to see the pinout.
 *
 * EagleTree sensors
 * -----------------
 * Be very cautious, the pinout is not standard ! Any mistake will make the optical sensor to blow up instantly !
 * - red: GND !!!
 * - black: VCC for optical sensor IR LED. Must have a 100 Ω @ 5V. No more, no less.
 * - white: Signal. Must have a pull-up resistor (see below)
 *
 * Tests with:
 * - EagleTree Brushless RPM Sensor V2 - pull-up: 1 kΩ
 * - EagleTree Optical RPM Sensor - pull-up: 10 kΩ
 * - EagleTree Hall RPM Sensor - pull-up: 1 kΩ or 10 kΩ
