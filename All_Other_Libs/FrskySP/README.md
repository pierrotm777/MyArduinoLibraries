# arduino-frskysp
FrskySP (SmartPort) protocol library for Arduino - Arduino 1.5 compliant repository of [frsky-arduino](https://github.com/jcheger/frsky-arduino)

This library is in beta stage. All known sensors were tested and seem to work.

# documentation
Documentation was removed out of the repository. It is available on: https://www.ordinoscope.net/static/arduino-frskysp/docs/html/

You can also build it this way (must install doxygen obviously)

````sh
 cd src
 doxygen
````

The documentation will be built in "docs", at the root of the library.
